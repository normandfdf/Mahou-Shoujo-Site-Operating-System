# Mahou-Shoujo-Site-Operating-System
The Mahou Shoujo Site Operating System is an Arch-based Linux distro that is centered on the anime Mahou Shoujo Site.

After recently discovering the anime, my friend and I became fascinated by it. Since we had also recently gotten into Linux, we came up with the idea to create this project.

normandfdf is the programmer and handles most of the work, while Luca30000000 is the graphic designer.

This is our first time working on a project like this, so it's bound to have some imperfections and issues, but we will fix and improve them over time.
